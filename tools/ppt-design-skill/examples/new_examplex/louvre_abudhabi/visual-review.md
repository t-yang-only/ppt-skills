# Visual review — Louvre Abu Dhabi architectural dossier

## Gate 1: visual effect

**PASS for rendered layout and Prototype evidence**

The deck uses a nocturnal architectural editorial system: one dominant image or
diagram per page, restrained geometry, fine rules, and a consistent dark field.
The page sequence moves from atmosphere to geometry, urban figure, thermal field,
material logic, spatial sequence, and architectural position without reverting
to a repeated card grid.

## Gate 2: serious defects

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | PASS | 10 slides, 13.333 × 7.5 inches, rendered to PNG/PDF |
| R2 | PASS | P01 cover, P03 dome evidence, and P07 spatial sequence provide distinct page jobs |
| R3 | PASS | Architecture facts carry visible source labels on evidence pages |
| R4 | PASS | P03 keeps the dome metrics and technical explanation as native text and shapes |
| R5 | PASS | P01/P03/P07 representative PNG review found no visible overflow or clipping |
| R6 | PASS | Source-authoritative rebuild completed twice; canonical content matched |

## QA evidence

- PPTX structural inspection: 10 slides, 16:9, native text/picture/freeform mix.
- PPTX → PDF → PNG render: `rendered/slide01.png` through `slide10.png`.
- Representative pages P01, P03, and P07 were visually reviewed at 1280 × 720.
- Full formal scoring and second-reviewer sign-off remain pending; the related
  The three Louvre Prototype records are eligible for the runtime candidate set; Pack and visual acceptance gates remain separate concerns.

## Revision 4 — re-audit correction

- The full-page re-audit found a systematic page-number issue: slides 2, 6, 7,
  8, and 9 rendered their two-digit markers as vertically split characters,
  caused by undersized page-number text boxes.
- The affected text boxes were enlarged and moved upward in `build.py`; the
  deck was regenerated and rendered again.
- Slides 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9 were rechecked at 1280 × 720 and now show complete
  two-digit markers.
- This correction supersedes the earlier representative-page-only claim; full
  formal scoring and second-reviewer sign-off remain pending.
